Summary: Migration finished, now polishing based on pelican-cait


I have finished setting up the website, pruning and migrating content to pelican and tweaking with publishing workflow. *Hopefully*, this will help to ease some blog post publication...

I am kind of happy with the look'n feel from [pelican-cait][cait], as a start. I will probably start from [there][nigel], iteratively. If you have any feedback or remark, I would be glad to hear them (in the comment/disqus, by email, or else).

Cheers!
