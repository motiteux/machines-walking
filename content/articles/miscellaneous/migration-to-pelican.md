Summary: Current migration ongoing, DNS change in process


I am currently migrating all my domains to Digital Ocean. The change in DNS seems to be a little hectic (on and off constantly) for the past 12 hours.

Also, I am switching to [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/) and migrating contents that I had from several places (pruning a little in the same time).

Cheers!
